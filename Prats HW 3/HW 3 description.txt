+# Homework 
+ 
+Create a linear regression analysis report based on a datasample in ToyotaCorolla.csv.zip predicting the price of a car. 
+ 
+The dataset includes the following variable: 
+ 
+Price - The price of the car 
+Age - The age of the car in month 
+KM - Accumulated kilometer on the odometer 
+FuelType - Type of fuel used 
+HP - Horsepower of the car 
+MetColor - Whether the car has metallic (1) or not (0) 
+Transmission - Whether the car has automatic transmission (1) or not (0) 
+CC - Cylinder volumen in cubic centimeter 
+Doors - Number of doors 
+Weight - Weight of the car in kilogram 
+ 
+The report must include: 
+1. a section with the descriptive statistics, reporting the descriptive statistics in word and numbers, 
+2. a section with the linear regression analysis and the optimal solution, including the hypothesis, testing the assumptions and the result of these tests. 
+3. a section reporting your findings of the analysis 
+4. How much would a car cost, that has the following attributes: 
+	a. 12 month old 
+	b. Petrolium 
+	c. 185 hp 
+	d. Metallic Color 
+	e. Standard transmission 
+	f. 2000 CC 
+	g. 4 Doors 
+ 
+Deliver the report as a PDF document as well as a .Rmd file and add the .R file that you used to develop the model. 
+ 
+Deliver the information as a separate folder using Github by using your own folder within the OPS804 organization (take a look at the PDF I sent earlier), not in your own Github repository! 
+ 
+Your folder should include this structure: 
+ 
+HW 3/ 
+	- data 
+	- report 
+	- graphs
